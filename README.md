# 8bitComputerCode
This repository holds any and all code for my version of an 8-bit breadboard computer including Assembly code and Arduino C code.

This 8-bit computer code is based on Beneater's computer known as the simple as possible or SAP-1 for short.
The link to his youtube channel is as follows: https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater
I am modifying his code and design to improve it to allow the computer I am buidling to run the game 'Snake' on an LCD display using a NES controller or a custom controller.
I would reccomend checking out his videos if you wish to create this project in its basic form.

NOTE: The code in this repo does not work without the construction of the 8-bit computer. This code is used to deploy microcode to EEPROM's located on the 8-bit CPU.
